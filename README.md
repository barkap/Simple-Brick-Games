# About
This is a fork of [Simple-Brick-Games](https://github.com/TobiasBielefeld/Simple-Brick-Games) with additional settings menu "Max Speed" which allows you to set max speed level for games. Tested briefly.

There are no releases on market, but you can compile it yourself or download and install an apk file from [releases tab](https://github.com/barkap/Simple-Brick-Games/releases) (you will have to enable the unknown sources system setting, found in Settings > Security).

## Usage description from the original author
If you want to use my work for your own project (which means in most cases: Put ads in it and publish on Google Play Store) YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE GPL LICENSE! This means, your project MUST be open source under a GPLv3+ compatible license and MUST contain attribution for the original work! I already found a lot of copies which simply removed my "About Game" screen and changed some graphics. If I see your work violating the GPL rules, I will let it get removed by Google. 

So please follow the rules! Use this attribution text (or a similar one)
